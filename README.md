# sprucebot-cli
Hey, I'm Sprucebot! This CLI was designed to give you the tools you need
to help brick-and-mortar businesses thrive in the Internet age. Once I'm
up and running in a store, you'll be able to react to real world events, such
as guests entering or leaving.

Once your skill is ready and making an impact, you can submit it to the
Skills Marketplace so other boutiques, bars, retailers, etc. can start
taking advantage of it.

Remember, our goal is to connect people, not replace them. So make
sure your skill promotes human-to-human connection.

# Skills Development
Skills are how you give me new... well, skills. A skill is really analogous to
an app. It needs to be fully featured and create a real world experience people remember.
Keep in mind as you're out saving small business that the thing that makes
brick-and-mortar unique is the fact that real people are interacting face-to-face.

It's the ultimate social network, and with your skills giving me the power to
facilitate amazing experiences, brick-and-mortar, ma and pa shops will live long into the future. ðŸŒ²ðŸ¤–
