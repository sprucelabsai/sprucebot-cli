# sprucebot-cli

Hey, I'm Sprucebot! This CLI was designed to give you the tools you need to begin building skills to help brick-and-mortar businesses thrive in the Internet age.

Our goal is to connect people, not replace them. So make
sure your skill promotes human-to-human connection.

## Skills Development

First there were desktop applications, then mobile apps, now we are entering the `Decade of the Skill`! üí•üí•üí•

They are the next step in `App Evolution`. They are interface agnostic. They react to real world events.

Beyond voice commands (Alexa -_COMING SOON_-, Google Home -_COMING SOON_-, HomePod -_COMING SOON_-). I can chat through pretty much any interface (sms, Facebook Messenger -_COMING SOON_-, etc.), I know when teammates arrive at work, when guests arrive at local businesses, when business owners ask to borrow a ladder from a neighbor -_COMING SOON_-, when guests message a business, EVEN WHEN SOMEONE BOOKS A HAIRCUT!! üíá

_But, to be clear; I take privacy very seriously and as a Skills Developer, I'm not gonna share much with you. Seriously, all you'll get is the guest's first name and a link to their profile photo in a few sizes. Oh, and you can only access data your skill collects. All data shared between skills is done through [Mercury](https://developer.spruce.ai)._

Anyway, what was I saying before things got all serious?

It's the ultimate social network, and with your skills giving me the power to
facilitate amazing experiences, brick-and-mortar, ma and pa shops will live long into the future. üå≤ü§ñ
